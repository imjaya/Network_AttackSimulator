# A WAN which has multiple 3 remote sites (subnets) connected to the main site

# main site has 3 subnets (1 server, 1 DMZ, 1 user)
# subnet 1 = main site DMZ (exposed, but not vulnerable) - contains 2 webservers
# subnet 2 = main site server (not exposed) - contains 2 data servers
# subnet 3 = main site user (not exposed) - contains 6 user hosts
# subnet 4 = remote site 1 (exposed) - contains 2 user hosts
# subnet 5 = remote site 2 (exposed) - contains 2 user hosts
# subnet 6 = remote site 3 (exposed) - contains 2 user hosts
# each remote site is connected to main site server subnet
